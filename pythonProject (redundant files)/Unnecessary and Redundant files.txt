As far as I can tell, these python files are unnecessary and redundant, so everything that has been uploaded into the other folder (Demo Files) should contain everything you need.

These were uploaded prior to completing the demos and before extra documentation was started. There might be something useful in these fils/folders but I dont think that is the case. I am keeping it in just in case someone finds it useful.
